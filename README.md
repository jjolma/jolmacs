# Introduction
This is my emacs setup. Most of this is stolen from [the Emacs Starter Kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/) and [Adam Doppelt's dotfiles](http://gurge.com/amd/emacs/).  I am building my emacs setup from scratch as an exercise to help me understand it better.

# TODO
* java-mode - 4 spaces per tab
* turn on column-mode by default
* shortcut for grep-find
* tab complete
* map ctl-z to scroll down, not minimize window
* remove trailing whitespace
* ruby-mode with Rakefile
* markdown mode
